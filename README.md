## Project Introduction

PureReader is a reading software that collects novels, books, comics and information.

Our product concept is to make the reading experience ubiquitous.

As you can see, PureReader is a **cross-platform** product with **data interoperability** and **consistent experience**.

PureReader is a **closed source software**, but it is a highly scalable software based on open source standards.

Capable users and developers can realize their own personalized reading experience by connecting with PureReader.
